## AWS WorkSpaces - Beginner - Usecases

- To support remote workers and enable organizations to have virtual desktops in the cloud, AWS provides Amazon WorkSpaces, a fully managed, persistent desktop virtualization service that enables your users to access the data, applications, and resources they need, anywhere, anytime, from any supported device. 

- Windows or Linux desktops can be provisioned in a few minutes. 

- Amazon WorkSpaces is deployed within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and no user data is stored on the local device. For non-persistent desktops and virtualized applications, AWS supports AWS AppStream 2.0, another service offering.
