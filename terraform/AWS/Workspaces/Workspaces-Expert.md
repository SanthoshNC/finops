## AWS WorkSpaces - Expert - Usecases

- To support remote workers and enable organizations to have virtual desktops in the cloud, AWS provides Amazon WorkSpaces, a fully managed, persistent desktop virtualization service that enables your users to access the data, applications, and resources they need, anywhere, anytime, from any supported device. 

- Windows or Linux desktops can be provisioned in a few minutes. 

- Amazon WorkSpaces is deployed within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and no user data is stored on the local device. For non-persistent desktops and virtualized applications, AWS supports AWS AppStream 2.0, another service offering.

## Use Case 1 :

Workspaces in the cloud can be used for onboarding new new remote employees, contract workers, and partners. You don’t want partners to be in your network, but at the same time, you want to collaborate with them remotely. You could set up temporary workspaces where both sets of staff (yours and partners’) can collaborate.


## Use Case 2 :

IT can quickly and easily configure and manage access. You can permit access to the internal sites of your choice by funneling outbound traffic from a WorkSpace through a web filter.


## Use Case 3 :

Some organizations run their entire business on SaaS applications and may have no physical offices. So, there is no on-premises infrastructure at all. In such cases, desktops in the cloud using services like AWS Workspaces is what they use.

## Use Case 4 :

Onboard your development teams (developers, QA, DevOps/SRE etc.) on AWS by providing them with their own AWS Workspace instance. They can also use WorkSpaces as a jumphost for secure remote access to AWS instances using private IPs.
