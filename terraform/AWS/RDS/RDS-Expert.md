# Relational Database Service (RDS) Use Cases
**Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed database service and therefore reduces a lot of burden surrounding managing, maintaining, and other database related tasks.**

## Use Case 1 :

Deploy a new database server in a matter of minutes while significantly increasing reliability and uptime without associated overhead or personnel costs. Good fit for OLTP/ transactional, moderately complex day-to-day database requirements.

## Use Case 2 :
You can customize the configuration for each database deployment with a number of database engines (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server). Set up automatic failover (multi-AZ RDS set-up), automated backups, and resize your database deployments seamlessly in line with traffic and application requirements. Allows you to focus on the application instead of managing the database.

## Use Case 3 :
Use RDS in conjunction with NoSQL databases such as DynamoDB (for low-latency/ high-traffic use cases) or Amazon OpenSearch Service (for text and unstructured data).
