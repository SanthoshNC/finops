Configure and Connect to Serverless MySQL Database

In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure and connect to Amazon Aurora Serverless.

Amazon Aurora is a relational database service with MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible editions, which offers the performance and availability of enterprise databases at a fraction of the cost. Aurora Serverless is a new on-demand auto-scaling configuration for Aurora which is now generally available for the Aurora MySQL-compatible edition. With Aurora Serverless, your database will automatically start up, shut down , and scale up or down capacity based on your application’s needs – so you’re never paying for what you don’t use, while still benefiting from Aurora’s high availability, scale, and speed.
