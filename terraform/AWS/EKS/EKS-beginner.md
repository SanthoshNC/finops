- Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS and on-premises. EKS lets you run your Kubernetes applications on both Amazon EC2 and AWS Fargate.

- EKS runs the Kubernetes control plane across multiple Availability Zones, automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes, and provides on-demand, zero downtime upgrades and patching. EKS offers a 99.95% uptime SLA. At the same time, the EKS console provides observability of your Kubernetes clusters so you can identify and resolve issues faster.

- With EKS, you have the advantage that any application running on EKS is compatible with one running in your existing Kubernetes environment. You can migrate to EKS without applying any changes to code.
