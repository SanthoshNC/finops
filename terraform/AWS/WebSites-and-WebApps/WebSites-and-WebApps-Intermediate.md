## AWS WebSites-and-WebApps - Intermediate - UseCases



## Use Case 1 :

Store and Retrieve a File

This step-by-step tutorial will help you store your files in the cloud using Amazon Simple Storage Solution (Amazon S3). Amazon S3 is a service that enables you to store your data (referred to as objects) in at massive scale. In this tutorial, you will create an Amazon S3 bucket, upload a file, retrieve the file and delete the file.

## Use Case 2 :

Batch upload files to the cloud

In this tutorial we are going to help you use the Amazon Command Line Interface (Amazon CLI) to access Amazon S3. We will do this so you can easily build your own scripts for backing up your files to the cloud and easily retrieve them as needed. This will make automating your backup process faster, more reliable, and more programmatic. You can use this information to build a scheduled task (or cron job) to handle your backup operations.

## Use Case 3 :
Build a WordPress Website - Deploy and host a production-ready WordPress website on AWS

In this project, you will learn how to deploy and host WordPress, an open-source blogging tool and content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL. You will implement an architecture to host WordPress for a production workload with minimal management responsibilities required from you. To accomplish this, you will use AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Once you upload the WordPress files, Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity, while managing time-consuming database administration tasks for you.
