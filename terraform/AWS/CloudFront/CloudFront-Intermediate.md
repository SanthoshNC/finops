- CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that enhances the user experience of any application running in the AWS cloud, outside the cloud, or on premises. The data is cached at the AWS edge locations, also known as points of presence (POPs). 

- These locations are used to deliver data, videos, images, apps, and APIs with high transfer speeds and low latency to consumers. It provides you with the ability to cache common responses from your HTTP/HTTPS web application by caching the responses to GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS HTTP methods, thus making it seem as if the application front end is much closer to the user than it actually is.

- It is often used in tandem with S3 to capture clickstreams from it and follow visitors as they navigate through other applications. CloudFront is secure and resilient to L3 and L4 DDoS attacks when used with AWS Shield.
